# FakePetay MBR

FakePetay MBR is a safe demonstration project written in assembly that mimics the visual behavior of the Petya ransomware MBR. Unlike the real malware, this project does not destroy data or permanently overwrite the disk. It is intended for educational and research purposes only. The project does not include any executables and contains only assembly source code. It also requires the original MBR to be stored in the second sector so the code can restore it after execution.
